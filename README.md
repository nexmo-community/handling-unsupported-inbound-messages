<img src="https://developer.nexmo.com/assets/images/Vonage_Nexmo.svg" height="48px" alt="Nexmo is now known as Vonage" />

The demo shows you how to determine if an inbound Message from a social-messaging platform (e.g. WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, or Viber) is of an unsupported type.

## Welcome to Vonage

<!-- change "github-repo" at the end of the link to be the name of your repo, this helps us understand which projects are driving signups so we can do more stuff that developers love -->

If you're new to Vonage, you can [sign up for a Vonage API account](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/sign-up?utm_source=DEV_REL&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=unsupported-types) and get some free credit to get you started.

## How to Run

Install express and body parser with:

`npm install express body-parser`

Run the app with `node server.js`

Follow the guide for how to configure webhooks. You can do this with the [full Messages API](https://developer.nexmo.com/messages/code-snippets/inbound-message) - or if you're just getting started, with the [Messages API Sandbox](https://developer.nexmo.com/messages/concepts/messages-api-sandbox#configure-webhooks). With that done, all that's left to do is to send a message through a channel of your choice to your app!
